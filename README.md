# **Face Authentication Using Classical Image Processing**
*A face authentication system using traditional image processing techniques.*

---

## **📌 Overview**
This project implements a **face authentication system** using **classical image processing techniques** without deep learning models. It uses **facial landmark detection, alignment, and feature normalization** to compare facial features based on **Euclidean distance**.

### **🔍 Features**
✅ Face alignment based on **eye landmarks**  
✅ Symmetric **feature adjustment** for consistent representation  
✅ Euclidean distance-based **face matching**  
✅ **Threshold optimization** to improve recognition performance  
✅ Performance evaluation using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**

## **📂 Dataset**
The dataset consists of two main directories:

📁 **Face_DB/** (Authorized faces)  
- `Images/` → Frontal face images (e.g., `NAME_000.jpg`)  
- `Landmark_data/` → Corresponding **landmark CSV files**  

📁 **Test_DB/** (Test images)  
- `Images/` → Face images at different angles  
- `Landmark_data/` → Landmark CSVs for each test image  

Each person has **6 test images**, totaling **90 test samples**.

## **⚙️ Methodology**
### **1️⃣ Face Alignment Using Eye Landmarks**
- Faces were **aligned** using **eye landmarks** to ensure consistency.

### **2️⃣ Symmetrization of Facial Features**
- Each landmark was **mirrored** and adjusted to **reduce asymmetry** caused by angle variations.

### **3️⃣ Feature Extraction & Normalization**
- Jawline **excluded** to prevent distortions.  
- **Relative distances between landmarks** used instead of absolute positions.  
- Feature distances were **normalized** using the width of the left eye.

### **4️⃣ Face Matching Using Euclidean Distance**
- Euclidean distance was computed between the aligned and normalized feature vectors.

### **5️⃣ Threshold Selection for Best Performance**
- Thresholds were tested between **50 and 120** to optimize results.  
- **Best threshold: 73** (Selected based on F1-score).

## **📈 Key Learnings**
✔️ Preprocessing (alignment & normalization) is critical in face recogition.

✔️ Feature selection (excluding jawline) improves robustness to angles.

✔️ Euclidean distance works for simple comparisons but has limitations.

✔️ Empirical evaluation helps fine-tune parameters like the threshold.


## **🚀 Future Improvements**
🔹 Use machine learning models (e.g., SVM, k-NN) for improved classification.

🔹 Apply deep learning (CNNs, OpenCV DNN, or FaceNet) for robust face recognition.

🔹 Optimizr featue selection using principal component analysis (PCA).

🔹 Expand dataset to test on more diverse facial variations.
